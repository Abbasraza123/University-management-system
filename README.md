 University Management System (C++ / Data Structures)
 I recently completed a comprehensive University Management System in C++. 
The primary challenge of this project was a strict constraint to avoid all STL (Standard Template Library) containers, 
requiring the manual implementation of all data structures using pointers and memory management.

Key Technical Achievements:
Optimized Search: Built a Hash Table with chaining for O(1) average-time access to user directories.
Pathfinding: Implemented an Undirected Weighted Graph using Adjacency Lists and Dijkstra’s Algorithm to calculate shortest paths across campus.
Self-Balancing Trees: Developed AVL Trees to manage room resources, ensuring efficient scheduling and data retrieval.
Custom Memory Management: Implemented Stacks (LIFO) for messaging and Queues (FIFO) for ticketing systems entirely via Linked Lists.
Technologies: C++, Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), Visual Studio.
